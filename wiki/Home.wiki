Notes:
  # The code is generic, meaning that it can simply be copied into any Java application server.
    # The code is currently a straight Java Servlet.
    # SpringMVC and other implementation may be added in the future.
  # The code is developed in [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse], though should be portable to any IDE, with the appropriate changes.
  # To ease introduction, the project is configured to work with the latest version of [http://code.google.com/appengine/ Google Apps Engine].
    # When configuring the Google Apps Engine locally, add the following parameter in the Run/Debug Configuration within Eclipse for the Arguments tab, Program Arguments text block to allow reference to the server by a device other than localhost: {{{ -a 0.0.0.0 }}}. This should be placed just after the default entry of {{{ --port=8888 }}}.
