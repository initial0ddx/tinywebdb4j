#summary Information about the Apps Inventor Voting component

= Introduction =


Playing around with the App Inventor Voting Block ([http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/learn/reference/components/notready.html#Voting documentation]), it seems....

The block component "Voting1.RequestBallot" sends a POST request to the Voting1.ServiceURL to "/requestballot".  The response needs to be formatted like this:

{"isPolling": true, "idRequested": true, "question": "What color is the sky?", "options": ["red", "blue", "green"]}

If "isPolling" is false, then "Voting1.NoOpenPoll" is executed.

If "isPolling" is true, then "Voting1.GotBallot" is executed.

I have not yet figured out when "Voting.WebServiceError" is executed.

The block component "Voting1.SendBallot" sends a POST request to the Voting1.ServiceURL to "/sendballot".  The following two parameters must be passed: "userChoice" and "userId".

I have this running on a modified version of tinywebdb4j (https://code.google.com/p/tinywebdb4j/)
